## Day 19

<li> Worked with built-in function zip() which allows to quickly combine associated data-sets without needing to rely on multi-dimensional lists
<li> Also this is where I was introduced with tuples
<li> No real projects, just practice on codeacademy(tuples, lists, for loops and while loops)
