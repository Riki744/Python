1. Working on scrabble game project


## Scrabble.py planned improvments

- play_word() — a function that would take in a player and a word, and add that word to the list of words they’ve played
- update_point_totals() — turn your nested loops into a function that you can call any time a word is played
- make your letter_to_points dictionary able to handle lowercase inputs as well
