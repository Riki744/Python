## Day 14

<li> Today I wanted to push my self a bit and went to solve the challenge on HTB > challenges > misc > Eternal Loop, this required some scripting knowledge and
  the use of sqlite browser or simple CLI in Kali
<li> The script I created to solve the challenge is probably the worst code that can be, but it worked for me and it crashed when there was another password for zip file
