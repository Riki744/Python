# Day 30

<li> Today worked more with string methods and practiced with couple of tests in codeacademy
<li> Also learned new thing that so far I've not done, it's looping through multiple lists
  


```js
'Hello world'.upper()
'Hello world'.lower()
'Hello world'.tittle()
'Hello world'.split()
''.join(['Hello', 'world'])
'Hello world'.replace('H', 'J')
'  Hello world  '.strip()
'Hello world'.find('w')
```
