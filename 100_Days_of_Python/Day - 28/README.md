## Day 28

<li> We are back with python challenge, but probably will have to change name from 100days to 30days as I haven't managed to do them, so there is going to be new folder just for projects and casual stuff that I've created 
  
  <li> Anyway today worked with string slicing in codeacademy, but no real projects
